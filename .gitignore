# CRITICAL: DO NOT UPLOAD DATABASE.PHP IF IT CONTAINS PRODUCTION CREDENTIALS
# For a public repo, you should use environment variables instead of hardcoding.
# However, if your 'database.php' only has localhost creds, you can skip ignoring it for now.
# If you used a sensitive password for root/pass, make sure to change it or use environment variables!
